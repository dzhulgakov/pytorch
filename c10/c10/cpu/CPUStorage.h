// CPUStorage is NOT part of the public API
//
// Every Tensor is backed by a storage; multiple tensors may share the same storage
// (which is why we need an indirection.)
//
// This is implemented as a regular shared_ptr to reduce implementation
// cost.  Since it's internal we don't mind if it's a little clunky to use.
//
// In Caffe2, this was previously implemented directly as a std::shared_ptr.  Doing
// it this means that realloc is not possible because a std::shared_ptr only
// records the free() pointer.
//
// TODO: Consider making it possible to allocate CPUStorageImpl in the same block as a CPUTensor, so that
// allocating a tensor is only one dynamic allocation rather than two
// dzhulgakov: while I appreciate this approach - it's tricky as we'd need to override free/realloc functions and probably have higher cost.
//
// Roughly corresponds to THStorage from old ATen
// dzhulgakov: enabled_shared_from_this ?
class CPUStorageImpl {
  // smessmer to @ezyang: We might want to use folly::Function instead.
  //                      The folly::Function header is quite self contained, i.e. can be copied here without the rest of folly.
  // dzhulgakov: std::function is 32 bytes, we can be paranoid and probably optimize it to a single pointer as a common case is no custom deleter imho (just default to the context one)
  using data_t = std::unique_ptr<void, std::function<void(void*)>>;

  // NB: THAllocator is axed; instead, all you can pass now is a custom deleter,
  // which is enough tod o the important things.
  data_t data_;

  // dzhulgakov: do we ever need a flag to see whether storage is shared among several views or not? if we add enabled_shared_from_this then we can just use shared_ptr::use_count()

  std::size_t size_; // in bytes

  // Is this storage resizable?  If it comes externally, or has been shared to some external system, it may not be.
  // Corresponds to TH_STORAGE_RESIZABLE.
  //
  // Why do we need this flag?  The trouble comes from operations which *resize their underlying
  // storages.*  For example, consider the following PyTorch transcript:
  //
  // >>> x = torch.tensor([0,1,2])
  // >>> y = x[0:1]    # Make another view on this tensor
  // >>> x.resize_(4)  # Resize the underlying storage
  //
  // 0
  // 1
  // 2
  // 1
  // [torch.LongTensor of size (4,)]
  //
  // >>> x[0] = 4      # Modify the resized tensor
  // >>> y
  //
  // 4
  // [torch.LongTensor of size (1,)]
  //
  // First, notice that the only way to actually implement this behavior is to modify the actual underlying
  // storage: in general, if we resize a block of memory, it means that the pointer to that memory updates.
  // We need this pointer to update for ALL tensors which view the same data; thus the modification happens
  // in storage.  Second, notice that if we swap out the storage at one tensor to something that is
  // unresizable, ALL views on that tensor need to reject further resizes.  So the correct place to store
  // this information is indeed in Storage.  This is not an operation you'd ever need to actually do,
  // but it makes clear where this information semantically belongs.
  //
  // dzhulgakov: omg, do we have to support this behavior? sounds kind of too fancy - do people rely on it often? In my mind if one resizes the storage all views are de-facto invalidated - I'd basically just allocate the new storage instead.
  // dzhulgakov: we should document this behavior if we keep it - it's pretty non-obvious
  //
  // TODO: pack this boolean flag?
  bool resizable_;

  // NB: I axed TH_STORAGE_FREEMEM; the expectation is you install a no-op
  // deallocator if this is what you want.
  // NB: I axed TH_STORAGE_VIEW; it makes things complicated for not a good enough
  // reason
  // NB: I axed TH_STORAGE_REFCOUNTED; it seems to always be turned on.  If we do want
  // this, it would be a good fit for the Retainable class.
