  // "count" the same), and perhaps add a bit to storage which tells us if
  // it is "external" or "internal" (external storages don't count for accounting
  // purposes.)
  // NB: reserved from Caffe2 axed; as there are TWO sizes, we can easily
  // implement the reserved pattern by having the storage be larger than the
  // size recorded in a Tensor.  Hooray!

  //    stride[i] == 0 (broadcasting)
  //    stride[i] < 0 (negative strides)
  //    size[i] == 0 (useful to maintain size information!)
  //    stride[i] % size[i-1] != 0 (rolling window strides / not "embeddable")
  //    len(size) == 0 (scalars)
  // dzhulgakov: how much "stride analysis" do implementations usually do in TH?
